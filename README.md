# Hi, I'm Ozgur Ozbek

**I'm a hobbyist developer that is interested in building tools and running or playing games.**

Here you'll find a collection of my public products, scripts or code repositories. Almost all of my work or commissioned repositories are private. The remaining are either playground material or small projects. If you have a suggestion or there is something you would like to see me work on in the future, drop an issue **[here](https://github.com/ozgurozbek/ozgurozbek/issues)**!

You should definitely [check out my Random Sidequest Idea Generator](https://xeculus.pythonanywhere.com/)!
