# Hi, I'm Ozgur Ozbek

**A computer engineer that is interested in building tools and interacting with games.**

Here you'll find a collection of my public products, scripts, or code repositories. Almost all of my work or commissioned repositories are private. The remaining are either playground material or small projects. If you have a suggestion or there is something you would like to see me work on in the future, drop an issue **[here](https://github.com/ozgurozbek/ozgurozbek/issues)**!

You should definitely [check out my D&D5E Quest Idea Generator](https://xeculus.pythonanywhere.com/)! It has generated over a million prompts and is actively used by 10000+ individuals monthly!
